Thank you for actually opening the read me file!

The game file is named 'BeardQuest.html' don't open the 'engine.js' file because that's not the right file!
The game is text-based, so no fancy graphics.
When you go to use or equip an item, it is case sensitive.(Item: Protein Shake | Correct: Protein Shake | Incorrect: proteinshake)
The quest of the game is simple, you lost your beard and you're trying to find it.
You have to beat atleast 8 bosses before the final boss. 
Note: The game does use pop-up boxes and if you get and option along the lines of "Prevent page from creating additional dialogs" DO NOT check it otherwise you'll have to reset the game.

Items Colors:
White = Consumables
Green = Common
Blue = Uncommon
Red = Rare
Purple = Special(Boss weapons)

Enemy Colors:
Green = Standard Enemy
Orange = Boss (You may need to run if you encounter one early)
Red = Final Boss
